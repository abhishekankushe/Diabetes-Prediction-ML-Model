ML pipeline + Streamlit app for diabetes prediction


#  Diabetes Prediction using Decision Tree & Streamlit

This project predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**.  
It applies **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and a Decision Tree classifier**, deployed with **Streamlit**.

---

##  Features
- Data preprocessing with handling of missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with insights
- Tuned Decision Tree model with pipeline (joblib)
- Interactive **Streamlit app** for predictions
- Custom CSS UI enhancements
- Modular code for reusability
